Description: Gnuplot is a portable command-line driven graphing utility for Linux, 
  OS/2, MS Windows, OSX, VMS, and many other platforms. The source code is copyrighted 
  but freely distributed (i.e., you don't have to pay for it). It was originally 
  created to allow scientists and students to visualize mathematical functions and 
  data interactively, but has grown to support many non-interactive uses such as 
  web scripting. It is also used as a plotting engine by third-party applications 
  like Octave. Gnuplot has been supported and under active development since 1986.
